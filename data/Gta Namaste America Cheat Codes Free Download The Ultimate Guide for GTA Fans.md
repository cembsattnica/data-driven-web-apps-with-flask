Cheat codes are special combinations of letters that you can type during the game (do not pause) to trigger different cheats. You can use them as many times as you want, but be careful: some cheats may have negative consequences, such as increasing your wanted level or making the game unstable. Also, do not save the game with the cheats active, as they may corrupt your save file.

    Some cheat codes may conflict with each other or cause glitches in the game. For example, if you activate RIPAZHA and BUBBLECARS at the same time, the cars will fly and float away when hit. If you activate MUNASEF and PPGWJHT at the same time, the game will become very fast and hard to control. If you activate too many cheat codes at once, the game may crash or freeze. Therefore, it is advisable to use cheat codes sparingly and deactivate them when not needed.

    To deactivate a cheat code, you need to enter it again. For example, to deactivate RIPAZHA, you need to type RIPAZHA again. Some cheat codes cannot be deactivated once activated, such as AEZAKMI and UZUMYMW. To deactivate these cheat codes, you need to either load a previous save file or start a new game. You can also use a cheat code called TESTEDUCATIONALSKILLS to remove all cheat effects and reset the game to normal.
